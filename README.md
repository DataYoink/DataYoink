### Input Requirements


### Have any issues or suggestions?
We'd love to hear your input! We are planning to release version 2 later this year
with support for different types of plots, a more accurate model, and less reliance
on user input with the goal of making this a flexible tool that can be applied with
the push of a button. If there are any features that you would like to see in version 2
or suggestions for improving the current features, please let us know by submitting
an issue on github.
