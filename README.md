# DataYoink <br />
A plot digitizer for battery discharge plots and dQdV plots from scientific literature <br />


**Input:** A 2D scientific figure (.jpg). <br /> 
**Output:** .csv file with data points (extracted from input) with column labels based on the legend, and axis labels/units <br />
**Basic Use:** Works as a python module (eg. import into a python file), or local executable (.exe) <br />
### Use Cases: <br />

1.	Extract datapoints from battery discharge curves <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Target Users: A + B/C  <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	Input: .jpeg images of battery discharge figures <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	Output: Coordinates of datapoints on the discharge figures and axes labels <br />
2.	Extract datapoints from battery dQdV curves <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Target Users: A + B/C  <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	Input: .jpeg images of battery dQdV figures <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	Output: Coordinates of datapoints on the dQdV figures and axes labels <br />
3.	Extract legend and axis labels from generic scientific plots <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Target Users: A + E <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	Input: Generic 2D scientific figures with an x axis and a y axis <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	Output: Labels, units, and ranges of the x and y axes. <br />
4.	Clean up and digitize blurry battery discharge curves or dQdV curves <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Target Users: A + D <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	Input: .jepg image of a blurry battery discharge plot or dQdV plot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	Output: Coordinates of the datapoints and axis labels and range <br />
5.	Build new plot digitizer for a different scientific figure based on existing structure <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Target Users: A + F <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	Input: Trained neural network that identifies the locations of datapoints on certain types of figures <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	Output: A plot digitizer for a new figure type <br />

### Target Users: <br />
<ol type='A'>
<li>Users with basic working knowledge of terminal or python coding experience, and ability to change image file formats to desired input form </li> 
<li>Battery Researchers with data science background who want to collect data from literature to look for treds between many figures</li>
<li>Battery researchers who want to compare their own data to literature values more easily</li>
<li>Battery researchers with older/blurry data that they want to repair and investigate (visually or through data science) </li>	
<li>Researchers (in general) who want to compare scientific plots with different units </li>
<li>Researchers (in general) with more advanced python and neural network experience who want to develop a plot digitizer for a different type of plot </li>
</ol>

This is Doris trying out the Github version control techniques. I just created a branch and now I will merge. <br />
Hopefully when it merges something went wrong. Yayayaya. !!!!1!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay now try ing to create some mess.<br />
Note for Git Version contol:<br />
1. git checkout branch<br/>
2. git add/commit/push<br/>
3. git checkout main<br/>
4. git merge branch
